Cloudanators - euv
==================

These are Erlang bindings to libeuv. There goals for this project are to
create a stable binding to libuv's file handling and demonstrate how that
affects file IO for processes with large mailboxes.

If that work goes quickly enough I'll add wrappers to the networking parts
of libuv and lastly if time I'll add the HTTP parser from node and compare
that against Erlang's builtin HTTP packet parsing.
